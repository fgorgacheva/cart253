# Space Exploration
## Project 1: Simulation 

## Known Issues:
- when the game begins (after pressing space), if the mouse is not moved right away, the usesr controlled spaceship sprite retreats to the top left corner and triggers the interaction with the alien spaceship, even though the alien ship isn't there.
- if the left mouse button is held down on a celestial object it displays an information card about the object, but if the mouse button is kept down and the mouse is dragged to the next object, it will display that object's card too, rather than have to individually click on each object as you get to them. Both implementations currently work, but it should be the latter.

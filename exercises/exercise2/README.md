# Dodge em!

## Little covid19 game
- user is circle controlled by mouse
- virus follows user
- the closer virus moves to the user (or user gets to the virus), the redder the user becomes
- if user goes home (hover over the house) virus cannot follow, home is a safe space
- if user touches the virus, user becomes infected, game over

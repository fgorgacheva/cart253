## How it works
- User is Jason Todd, placed at mouse position. Move Jason over Bruce to get Batman and Robin. If either character leaves canvas, they never meet and it's sad.
- Jason Todd was killed by the Joker in a warehouse explosion, so placing Jason over the warehouse will trigger an easter egg

## Disclaimer
- Sound effects were added and may be quite loud. Please lower your sound volume just in case.
- No Robins were hurt in the making of this game.
